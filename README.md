# Work_Samples
Work samples stripped of any company data to provide a basic overview of skillset

Each project is documented in the Code_Samples file.

These are meant to be code samples and not production-level implementations. It is intended for someone with similar skills to read through rather than run the code.

Although the code was validated and will run the project is copied into its own .py file and has the proper packages in the current environment.
