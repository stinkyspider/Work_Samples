# Work Samples

This repository contains work samples designed to demonstrate technical skills across data analysis, automation, machine learning, and mentoring. All examples are stripped of any company-specific data to provide a general overview of capabilities while maintaining confidentiality.

## About These Code Samples

- Each project is documented in the **Code_Samples.py** file, showcasing different analytical and technical approaches.
- These are **illustrative code samples**, not full production-ready implementations. They are meant to highlight methodology, problem-solving techniques, and technical expertise.
- The provided scripts are designed to be read and understood by someone with similar technical skills rather than directly executed without modification.

## Running the Code

- The code has been validated and will execute correctly **if placed in a `.py` file and run in an environment with the necessary dependencies installed**.
- The required Python packages should be installed in the current environment before execution. If needed, install dependencies using:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
  ```
- Some code may require dataset placeholders. Ensure that relevant CSV files or database connections are set up where applicable.

## Project Highlights

1. **Automated Reporting & Anomaly Detection** (Python, SQL)  
   - Implements data processing, rolling averages, and statistical deviation detection to identify significant changes in business metrics.

2. **Historical Booking Predictions** (Machine Learning in Python)  
   - Builds a predictive model to forecast booking trends using `scikit-learn` with feature engineering and model evaluation.

3. **Mentorship & Technical Leadership** (Python, SQL)  
   - Includes training examples for junior analysts, covering data validation, SQL best practices, and structured coding techniques.

Each project is structured to showcase a mix of **data processing, automation, machine learning, and technical mentorship** skills. While the samples are simplified for clarity, they reflect real-world analytical workflows and best practices.
