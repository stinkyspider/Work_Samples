# Work Samples

This repository contains work samples designed to demonstrate technical skills across data analysis, automation, machine learning, and mentoring. All examples are stripped of any company-specific data to provide a general overview of capabilities while maintaining confidentiality.

## About These Code Samples

- Each project is contained in its own Python script for easy execution.
- These are **illustrative code samples**, not full production-ready implementations. They are meant to highlight methodology, problem-solving techniques, and technical expertise.
- The provided scripts are structured for clarity and reproducibility, ensuring ease of understanding and modification.

## Running the Code

Each project is self-contained in a separate `.py` file. To run a specific project, execute the corresponding Python script:

```bash
python automated_reporting.py
python historical_booking_predictions.py
python mentorship_training.py
python automated_email_alerts.py
```

### Dependencies
Ensure you have the required Python packages installed before running the scripts:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, install individual dependencies as needed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

Some code may require dataset placeholders. Ensure that relevant CSV files or database connections are set up where applicable.

## Project Highlights

### 1. Automated Reporting & Anomaly Detection (`automated_reporting.py`)
- Implements data processing, rolling averages, and statistical deviation detection to identify significant changes in business metrics.
- Helps automate alerting for unusual patterns in data.

### 2. Historical Booking Predictions (`historical_booking_predictions.py`)
- Builds a predictive model to forecast booking trends using `scikit-learn` with feature engineering and model evaluation.
- Uses machine learning techniques to analyze past booking behaviors and predict future demand.

### 3. Mentorship & Technical Leadership (`mentorship_training.py`)
- Includes training examples for junior analysts, covering data validation, SQL best practices, and structured coding techniques.
- Provides fundamental exercises to reinforce best practices in data analytics and pipeline development.

### 4. Automated Email Alerts (`automated_email_alerts.py`)
- Integrates with anomaly detection from `automated_reporting.py` to send automated email alerts for significant deviations in data.
- Uses Python's `smtplib` and `email` libraries to format and send notifications.

Each project is structured to showcase a mix of **data processing, automation, machine learning, and technical mentorship** skills. While the samples are simplified for clarity, they reflect real-world analytical workflows and best practices.
